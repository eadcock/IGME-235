All the preperations have finally been finished, and this halloween the skeletons are finally ready to strike back. It's time to free your brethren from their fleshy prisons.

## Aesthetics
The game will use a cartoony artstyle with horror elements that don't take itself too seriously.

The player will passively gain members in their army.

Mini-events will also occassionally occur, stepping the player through a scenario that may ultimately help or hurt their army size depending on their decision.
